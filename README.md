  ## üß≥ Submission
    content: Please submit a public GitHub repository link containing your extension code and the README. Good luck!

  ### ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Setup (Python + Flask)
    steps:
      - Clone the Repository
      - Install Rust (Required for `bittensor_wallet`):
        - `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
        - `source $HOME/.cargo/env`
        - Ensure Rust is installed with: `rustc --version`
      - Install Python Dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
      - Run the Flask Backend: `python3 wallet.py` (Server starts at http://localhost:3000)

  ### üßπ Chrome Extension Setup
    steps:
      - Open Chrome Extensions Page: `chrome://extensions/`
      - Enable Developer Mode
      - Click "Load unpacked"
      - Select the `dist/` directory inside the cloned project
      - The extension named **TAO Wallet Extension** should now appear and be usable


## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage Instructions

### 1. Enter Wallet Name and Password
![Enter wallet name and a user password](images/1.png)

*This will redirect a request to the Flask server where actual wallet creation takes place.  
Select and re-enter a password to create your wallet.  
(In future versions, password-based generation and encryption should move to client-side.)*

---

### 3. Wallet Added, Locked View
![Hotkey available but locked](images/3.png)
*Once added, your wallet hotkey (blurred) will be shown.  
You will need the user password you created earlier to unlock it.*

---

### 4. Unlocking Wallet
![Hotkey unlocked after entering password](images/4.png)
*Enter your password to unlock the 12-word mnemonic (hotkey).*

---

### 5. Copying Mnemonic
